Task:

Given an INPUT trigger name and a DATASET (JSONL: one JSON object per line) containing fields:

- trigger_name

- resource_name

- priority

- type

- recommended_action

 

Return exactly ONE JSON object from the dataset that best matches the input trigger name according to the rules below.

 

Important Constraints:

- Use ONLY the dataset included in this prompt; do NOT use cache or previous answers.

- If recommended_action is missing or equals the string "nan", return it as an empty string "".

 

Matching Rules:

1) Perform a LIKE-style match of the input against each row's trigger_name:

   - Case-insensitive

   - Trim leading/trailing whitespace on the input before matching

   - A LIKE match is true if the dataset's trigger_name appears as a substring within the normalized input OR vice versa.

2) If multiple rows match, choose the one with the longest matched span (most specific).

3) If there is NO match, return this exact JSON (no extra text):

{

  "trigger_name": "<input>",

  "resource_name": "",

  "priority": "",

  "type": "",

  "recommended_action": ""

}

 

Output Format:

- Return exactly ONE JSON object (no surrounding prose), with fields:

  - trigger_name

  - resource_name

  - priority

  - type

  - recommended_action

 

Steps to Follow:

1) Normalize the input: trim whitespace and lowercase for matching (preserve original case in output fields from the dataset).

2) For each dataset row, compare normalized strings and determine if they LIKE-match. If yes, compute the length of the matched span.

3) Select the row with the longest matched span. If ties occur, prefer the row with the longer trigger_name; if still tied, pick the first occurrence.

4) Output the JSON for the selected row, normalizing recommended_action to "" when missing or "nan".

 

Inputs to substitute in this prompt when you run it:

- INPUT trigger name: <<INPUT_TRIGGER_NAME>>

- DATASET (JSONL content pasted below):

<<DATASET_JSONL>>
